== Erlang application/library for IRC protocol ==

ealirc is an Erlang application/library for IRC protocol. Initially designed
as IRC client, with some blurry plans to extend it to support server side.

This library is intended to fit well into OTP patterns, so several behaviours
are provided to ease implementation.

Note that this is just a library, so it doesn't provide any supervision tree
on its own, in the similar way that gen_tcp or gen_server don't do that.
